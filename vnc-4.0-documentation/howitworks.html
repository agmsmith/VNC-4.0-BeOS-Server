<a name="1"></a><h3>The VNC Protocol</h3>

The VNC protocol is a simple protocol for remote access to graphical
user interfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is based on the concept of a <i>remote
framebuffer</i> or<i> RFB</i>. In the past we have tended to refer to
the VNC protocol as the RFB protocol, so you may have seen this term
in other publications.&nbsp; The protocol simply allows a server to
update the framebuffer displayed on a viewer. Because it works at the
framebuffer level it is potentially applicable to all operating
systems, windowing systems and applications.  This includes X/Unix,
Windows, and Macintosh, but might also include PDAs, and
indeed any device with some form of communications link. The protocol
will operate over any reliable transport such as TCP/IP.&nbsp;

<p>

This is truly a "thin-client" protocol: it has been designed to make
very few requirements of the viewer. In this way, clients can run on
the widest range of hardware, and the task of implementing a client is
made as simple as possible.&nbsp;

<a name="2"></a><h3>Rectangular updates</h3>

The display side of the protocol is based around a single graphics
primitive: <i>"put a rectangle of pixel data at a given x,y
position"</i>. This might seem an inefficient way of drawing arbitrary
user interface components. But because we have a variety of different
<i>encoding schemes</i> for the pixel data, we can select the
appropriate scheme for each rectangle we send, and make the most of
network bandwidth, client drawing speed and server processing
speed.&nbsp; <p>The lowest common denominator is the so-called
<i>raw</i> encoding, where the rectangle is simply pixel data sent in
left-to-right scanline order. All clients and servers must support
this encoding. However, the encodings actually used on any given VNC
connection can be negotiated according to the abilities of the server,
the client, and the connection between the two.&nbsp; <p>The <i>copy
rectangle</i> encoding, for example, is very simple and efficient and
can be used when the client already has the same pixel data elsewhere
in its framebuffer. The server simply sends an X,Y coordinate giving
the position&nbsp; from which the client can copy the rectangle of
pixel data. This means that operations such as dragging or scrolling a
window, which involve substantial changes to the screen, may only
require a few bytes. Most clients will support this encoding, since it
is generally simple to implement and saves bandwidth.&nbsp; <p>A
typical workstation desktop has large areas of solid colour and of
text. Some of our most effective encodings take advantage of this by
efficiently describing rectangles consisting of one majority
(background) colour and 'sub-rectangles' of different colours. There
are numerous other possible schemes.&nbsp; We might use a JPEG
encoding for still images or MPEG for efficient transmission of moving
images. An encoding which uses some kind of caching of pixel data
would be good for rendering text, where the same character is drawn in
the same font multiple times. Subsequent occurrences of the same
character would be encoded simply by reference to the first
occurrence.

<a name="3"></a><h3>Adaptive update protocol</h3>

A sequence of these rectangles makes a <i>framebuffer update</i> (or
simply <i>update</i>).  An update represents a change from one valid
framebuffer state to another, so in some ways is similar to a frame of
video, but it is usually only a small area of the framebuffer that
will be affected by a given update.  Each rectangle may be encoded
using a different scheme.&nbsp; The server can therefore choose the
best encoding for the particular screen content being transmitted and
the network bandwidth available.  <p>The update protocol is
demand-driven by the client. That is, an update is only sent by the
server in response to an explicit request from the client. This gives
the protocol an adaptive quality. The slower the client and the
network are, the lower the rate of updates becomes. Each update
incorporates all the changes to the 'screen' since the last client
request.  With a slow client and/or network, transient states of the
framebuffer are ignored, resulting in reduced network traffic and less
drawing for the client.&nbsp; This also improves the apparent response
speed.

<a name="4"></a><h3>Input protocol</h3>

The input side of the protocol is based on a standard workstation
model of a keyboard and multi-button pointing device. Input events are
sent to the server by the client whenever the user presses a key or
pointer button, or whenever the pointing device is moved. These input
events can also be synthesised from other non-standard I/O devices.

<a name="5"></a><h3>Connection Setup and Shutdown</h3> 

When the connection between a client and a server is first
established, the server begins by requesting authentication from the
client using a challenge-response scheme, which typically results in
the user being prompted for a password at the client
end. The server and client then exchange messages to
negotiate desktop size, pixel format, and the encoding schemes to be
used. The client then requests an update for the entire screen, and
the session begins.&nbsp; Because of the stateless nature of the
client, either side can close the connection at any time without
adverse consequences.  

<a name="6"></a><h3>VNC Clients</h3> 

Writing an VNC viewer is a simple task, as it should be for any
thin-client system. It requires only a reliable transport (usually
TCP/IP), and a way of displaying pixels (either directly writing to
the framebuffer, or going through a windowing system). VNC clients
exist for all flavours of Unix, Windows, Macintosh, Java and for
smaller handeld appliances.

<a name="7"></a><h3>VNC Servers</h3> 

Writing an VNC server is slightly harder than writing a client for a
number of reasons. The protocol is designed to make the client as
simple as possible, so it is usually up to the server to perform any
necessary translations.  For example, the server must provide pixel
data in the format the client wants. There are servers Unix, Windows
and Macintosh platforms A Unix machine can run a number of Xvnc
servers for different users, each of which represents a distinct VNC
desktop. Each VNC desktop is like a virtual X display, with a root
window on which several X applications can be displayed.&nbsp; 

The Windows server (WinVNC) is a little more difficult to create,
because there are fewer places to insert hooks into the system to
monitor display updates, and a less clearly-defined model of multiuser
operation. Servers simply mirrors the real display to a remote client,
which means that the server is not 'multiuser'. It does, however,
provide the primary user of a PC with remote access to their desktop.
