<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>x0vncserver</B>

is a VNC server which continuously polls any X display, allowing it to be
controlled via VNC.  How usable it will be depends a lot on the machine it's
running on, and what you're expecting.  It won't be as fast as Xvnc or a native
X server with VNC support compiled in, but in many cases it is the best option
since it is just an ordinary X application requiring no special installation.
<P>
It has many of the same parameters as Xvnc.  Running <B>x0vncserver -h</B> will
give a list of parameters with descriptions.  Note that you need to explicitly
specify an appropriate password file using the PasswordFile parameter.
