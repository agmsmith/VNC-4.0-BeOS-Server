<b>VNC doesn't seem to work properly with Windows XP</b>

<p>

VNC will work with XP provided that Fast User Switching and Remote
Administration are not used. Windows XP uses the Terminal Services
system to implement Fast User Switching and Remote Administration.
This is not compatible with the current release of VNC, but will be
supported better in a future release.

<p>

<b>VNC causes my Windows NT/2000/XP machine to blue screen</b>

<p>

Windows NT Version 4 has bugs in the API which is used by VNC. You
must have service pack 3 or higher installed to avoid problems.

<p> 

On Windows 2000/XP there are reports that blue screens occur as a
result of having Microsoft Hotfix ??? installed, with or without VNC
installed.

<p>

VNC does not install any system level hooks or driver
software. Consequently it cannot cause machines to crash except by by
exposing bugs in the undelying operating system and device drivers. If
it appears that VNC causes your machine to crash, check that you have
the latest service packs, graphics drivers and network drivers
installed for your system.

<p>

<b>My computer uses roaming profiles, and with VNC installed the
profiles are sometimes not saved back to the server. It can take a
very long time to log out.</b>

<p>

Versions of VNC prior to 3.3.6 have a bug that can cause this
behaviour. Additionally we have had reports Windows 2000 machines with
Hotfix Q329170 installed exhibit the same behaviour, with or without
VNC installed.
